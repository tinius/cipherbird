Send end-to-end encrypted Twitter direct messages.

## Notes
This app was created for a university course. It's the first Angular app i've ever written.

*Important*: This application can in *no way* be considered secure in a cryptographical sense! Not only is in-browser 
crypto widely disputed among cryptographers, but I'm also an amateur in the field. The goal of the course assignment was to learn about working
with REST APIs â€“ I just wanted to try out the Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library for fun.
